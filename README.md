# Particle Simulator

A real-time interactive particle physics simulator with the following features:

- Interactive canvas showing particles with realistic physics
- Controls to adjust particle properties (count, speed, size, color)
- Ability to add particles by clicking on the canvas
- Physics simulation including gravity, bounce, and collision effects
- Adjustable simulation parameters (gravity, bounce, friction)
- Visual effects like particle trails and color changes based on velocity
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
